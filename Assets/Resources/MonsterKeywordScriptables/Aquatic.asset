  keywordName: Aquatic
  keywordDescription: "This creature can only live in the water and will never willingly
    move onto land. If forced onto land, it treats all ground as rough ground for
    the purposes of movement and must pass a Will Roll (TN16) every time it activates
    or suffer 5 points of damage. Aquatic creatures never have to make Swimming Rolls,
    treat water as normal instead of rough ground, and suffer no Fight penalties
    for being in the water.\r"
