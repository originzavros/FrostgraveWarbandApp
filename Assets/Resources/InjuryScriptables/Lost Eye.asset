  injuryDescription: "One of the figure\u2019s eyes has been damaged and rendered
    useless. It suffers a -1 to its Combat Roll whenever it is the target of a shooting
    attack. If a spellcaster receives two Lost Eye permanent injuries, they are effectively
    blind. If the warband\u2019s wizard fails to successfully cast Miraculous Cure
    to remove permanent injuries (note that a wizard may cast this spell on themselves
    or on their apprentice) in the following Out of Game spells step of the post-game
    sequence, the spellcaster must retire from exploring Frostgrave and is considered
    \u2018dead\u2019 for game purposes"
