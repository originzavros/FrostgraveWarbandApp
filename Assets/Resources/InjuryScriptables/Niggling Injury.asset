  injuryDescription: "The spellcaster\u2019s injury just never quite heals, and they
    are forced to use herbs, ointments, or minor magic to keep the pain at bay. The
    spellcaster must spend 30gc on these treatments before each game or start each
    game at -3 Health. This injury can be received twice \u2013 in which case the
    payment increases to 40gc and the penalty to -4 Health. Any further Niggling
    Injury results must be re-rolled. A 10gc discount applies to these payments for
    each apothecary in the warband.\r\r"
