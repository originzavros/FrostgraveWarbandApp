  injuryDescription: "The spellcaster suffered a broken jaw that never quite healed
    properly. The spellcaster has some difficulty with speaking, which affects their
    ability to lead their warband. Whenever this figure activates, it can only activate
    a maximum of two soldiers in its phase (instead of the normal three). So, an
    apprentice with a Smashed Jaw could only activate two soldiers in the Apprentice
    phase. If this injury is received a second time, the number of soldiers that
    may also activate in the phase is decreased to one. Any further Smashed Jaw results
    must be re-rolled.\r"
