  itemDescription: "It is assumed that the spellcaster has built a construct prior
    to using this spell to animate it.\nIf the spell is successfully cast, the construct
    immediately becomes a permanent member of the warband, taking the place of a
    soldier.\nA spellcaster must declare the size of construct they are attempting
    to animate (small,medium, or large - page 183) before rolling to cast the spell.\nThe
    larger the contruct, the harder it is to animate, so the following modifiers
    are applied to the Casting Roll: Small -0, Medium -3, Large -6.\nThere is no
    limit to the number of constructs in a warband other than the normal limits for
    soldiers.\nLarge constructs count as specialist soldiers, the others as standard
    soldiers. \r"
