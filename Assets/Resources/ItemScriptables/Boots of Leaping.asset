  itemDescription: A figure wearing these boots may make a special 'Leap' move per
    turn instead of a normal action. The distance of the Leap is equal to the figures
    normal available movement. Leap ignores rough terrain, and can be used in any
    direction. Figures that climb ignore the half movement penalty. The boots do
    not help with landing, so leaping to a surface more than 3" lower than their
    starting point will still take falling damage.
