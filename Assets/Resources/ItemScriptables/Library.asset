  itemDescription: "This is one of the many libraries scattered throughout the city.
    The volumes contained within this one have fallen to the ravages of weather and
    time. A few valuable texts have survived, however. After each game the warband
    may roll one die. On a 15\u201318, they find a random scroll. On a 19\u201320
    they discover a random grimoire."
