  itemDescription: 'This potion can only be used by a wizard immediately before a
    game.

    The wizard should immediately make a Will Roll (TN12).

    If successful,
    then the wizard gains an extra 50 experience points after the game.

    This
    does not count towards the 300 xp point maximum in a game.

    If unsuccessful,
    the wizard has 30 xp deducted from those earned during the game (cannot take
    the total xp gained for the game below 0).

    These 30 experience points are
    deducted from the maximum that can be earned (a wizard that fails can only gain
    270 max in a game).'
