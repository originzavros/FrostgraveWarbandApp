  itemDescription: 'If a figure carrying these shackles ever reduces a troll to 0
    Health in hand to hand combat, he may choose to use the troll shackles.

    The
    troll is captured and may be carried off the table as though it were a treasure
    token.

    The troll may be fielded in a future game as part of your warband,
    taking up a soldier slot.

    If the troll ever rolls a 1 for any roll during
    a game, it breaks the shackles and becomes an uncontrolled creature.

    Should
    a shackled troll ever be reduced to 0 Health, the shackles are destroyed.'
