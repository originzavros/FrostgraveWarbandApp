    table anywhere within line of sight.\nAfter the wraith is placed, roll a die
    and immediately move the wraith that many inches in a random direction.\nIf this
    would take the wraith off the board, then it is lost and is out of the game.\nOtherwise
    it activates in the next creature phase as normal.\nThis wraith is an uncontrolled
    creature.\r"
