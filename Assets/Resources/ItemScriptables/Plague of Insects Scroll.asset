  itemDescription: "The target figure is attacked by a cloud of stinging or biting
    insects that irritate and distract.\nThe cloud of insects has a 1\" radius centered
    on, and moving with, the target figure.\nIt affects all figures, including the
    target figure, fully or partially within it's radius.\nWhile being pestered by
    insects, a figure has -4 Fight and -4 Shoot (to a minimum of +0) and -2 to Casting
    Rolls.\nAfter this figure activates each turn, it may make a Will Roll with a
    Target Number equal to the Casting Roll.\nIf successful, the spell is cancelled.\nOther
    figures in the radius may simply move away to escape.\nA figure may only ever
    be affected by one Plague of Insects spell at a time, whether as a target or
    by virtue of being within the 1\" radius.\nLarge creatures, undead, and constructs
    are immune to this spell.\r"
