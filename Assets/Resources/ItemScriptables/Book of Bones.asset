  itemDescription: 'Only a wizard may use this magical text. Following the instructions
    within this volume, a wizard may use the Raise Zombie spell to create an animated
    skeleton instead. The spell is cast in the same way, the wizard gets a skeleton
    instead of a zombie.

    If this spell is cast out of game, the wizard has the
    option of paying 30gc to upgrade the skeleton to an Armored Skeleton. The warband
    may only contain one zombie/skeleton/armored skeleton at any one time. The wizard
    does not need to carry the book to use this ability, it can be stored in the
    vault.'
