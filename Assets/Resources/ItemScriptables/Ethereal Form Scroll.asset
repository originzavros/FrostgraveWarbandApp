  itemDescription: "The spellcaster becomes ethereal until the start of his next
    activation.\nHe may move through terrain as though it were not there and ignores
    all movement penalties for terrain, including climbing.\nThe figure may not pick
    up treasure and drops any treasure it was carrying.\nOnly another ethereal figure
    may force combat with the figure.\nThe figure still fights as normal, but can
    only cause damage if it is using a magic weapon.\nThe figure is immune to non-magic
    weapons.\nIf a spellcaster successfully casts this spell again the following
    turn, they gain the above benefits as normal, but automatically suffers 5 damage.\r"
