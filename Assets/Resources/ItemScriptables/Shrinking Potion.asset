  itemDescription: 'A figure that is carrying treasure may use the potion to shrink
    it down to a size that will fit in a pocket.

    This figure no logner suffers
    any penalties to Move, Fight, or swimming for carrying this treasure.

    It
    may even carry a second treasure token.

    If the effect of this potion is
    cancelled while the figure is carrying two treasures, it must choose one and
    immediately drop it.

    If the shrunk treasure is dropped for any reason, it
    returns to its normal size.'
