  itemDescription: 'Once per game, the bearer may use an action to blow on the horn.
    Treat this as a successfully cast Crumble spell.

    This spell can only target
    inanimate structures such as buildings and walls.

    The spellcaster rapidly
    speeds up the passing of time in a small area of the structure, causing it to
    collapse.

    This can create a doorway-sized hold through any wall, which
    should be indicated on the table somehow.

    The spell can also be used to
    collapse a section of floor beneath a figure standing on a level above the ground.

    In
    this case, the figure about to be affeted must pass a Move Roll (TN22) or fall
    to the next level down and taking damage appropriately.

    If this spell is
    cast on a wall created by the Wall spell, the wall is completely destroyed.

    If
    it is cast on terrain holding a Wizard Eye, the Wizard Eye is cancelled.'
