  itemDescription: "A summoning circle allows the wizard to attempt to summon a demon
    before a game, effectively adding an Out of Game (B) option to the Summon Demon
    and Control Demon spells. The wizard first attempts to cast Summon Demon, followed
    by Control Demon. If both spells are successful, a demon joins the warband as
    a temporary member per the rules for Summon Demon. This demon does not count
    towards the warband\u2019s maximum size. The wizard may not cast Control Demon
    or Summon Demon while this demon is in play."
