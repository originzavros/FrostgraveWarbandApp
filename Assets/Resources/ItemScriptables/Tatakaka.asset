  itemDescription: "This is a beautiful and magic songbird, whose feathers can be
    used as powerful magic enhancers, but only if they are shed naturally.\nIf a
    wizard has a tatakaka in his vault, he may roll a die after each game. \nOn 19-20,
    a feather has fallen from the bird. Every time a 20 is rolled, a second roll
    must be made.\nIf this second roll is a 1, then the tatakaka has died and should
    be removed from the wizard's vault.\nA tatakaka feather can be used by a spellcaster
    to add +1 to the Casting Roll of any one Out of Game spell. \nThe player must
    decide to use the feather before the casting roll is made, and the feather is
    consumed in the process.\nOnly one feather can be used per casting roll. A tatakaka
    feather can be sold for 25gc; A bird for 500gc.\nNeither can be bought, save
    from another player."
