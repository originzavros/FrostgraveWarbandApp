  itemDescription: "This spell targets a weapon of the spellcaster's choosing.\nIf
    cast on a melee weapon, this weapon counts as a magic weapon with +1 fight.\nBows
    and crossbows count as magic weapons with +1 shoot, but the attack made with
    them do not count as magic attacks.\nThis spell may be cast on a single arrow
    or crossbow bolt, in which case that ammunition gives +1 Shoot and its attack
    counts as magic, but for the next shooting attack only.\nThis spell may only
    be cast once on each weapon.\nWhen using both a magic missile weapon and magic
    ammunition, the shooter may choose to apply the bonus of one or the other, but
    not both.\r"
