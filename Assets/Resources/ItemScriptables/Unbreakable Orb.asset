  itemDescription: Once per game, a figure may activate the Unbreakeable Orb, which
    surrounds the figure in an invisible and imprenetrable field. It can only be
    activated during the bearers activation, but does not require an action to use.
    The shield lasts until the figures next activation, the bearer cannot do anything
    other pick up a treasure it is in base contact with and may take no other actions
    or abilities. As a result, enemies cannot effect or harm the bearer in any way,
    and cannot move into combat with the bearer. If the bearer activates the item
    while in combat, it is considered to be no longer in combat until it activates
    again on its next turn and is still base to base. (pg 51 for any clarifications)
