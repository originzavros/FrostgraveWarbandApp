  itemDescription: 'This ring may only be worn by a spellcaster. Once per game, the
    wearer of the ring can spend an action to transfer

    up to 5 points of their
    own Health to another member of their warband that is in line of sight, on a

    1-for-1
    basis. So, if the wearer spend 3 Health, they may transfer 3 Health to another
    warband member.

    This may not take the other warband member above their
    starting Health.'
