  itemDescription: 'This is a rare artefact that may only be obtained by playing
    the Lair of the Ghoul king scenario, or by trading for it from a player who got
    it from the scenario(it cannot be purchased normally). This item gives the wearer
    a +1 to all Will rolls.

    Furthermore, it grants a +2 to the casting roll
    when casting Control Undead on a ghoul. Finally, if the wearer successfully casts
    a Raise Zombie spell Out of Game, then a ghoul may be added to his warband in
    place of a zombie.

    The warband may still only have one zombie or ghould
    in the warband at any one time.'
