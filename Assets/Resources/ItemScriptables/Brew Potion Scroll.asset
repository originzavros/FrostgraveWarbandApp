  itemDescription: "The spellcaster creates one Lesser Potion of their choice (page
    86) that may be sold, stored in the wizard's vault or given to a member of the
    warband.\nA wizard (and only wizard) may use this spell to create a Greater Potion
    (page 87). \nFirst, they must declare what potion they are attempting to brew
    and pay the listed ingredients cost.\nThe wizard should then roll to cast Brew
    Potion with a -4 to the Casting Roll.\nIf successful, the potion is created and
    can be immediately assigned to a figure in the warband, sold, or stored in the
    wizard's vault.\nIf unsuccessful, the potion is not created and the money spent
    on ingredients is lost.\r"
