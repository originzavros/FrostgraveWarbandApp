    of demon summoned depends on the amount by which the spellcaster succeeded on
    their Casting Roll: 0-5 imp, 6-12 minor demon,, 13+ major demon. \nIf a spellcaster
    rolls a 1 while attempting to cast this spell, they summon an uncontrolled demon
    and must place this demon in combat with the spellcater.\nRoll a die to determine
    the type of demon 1-10 imp, 11-17 minor demon, 18+ major demon.\nA spellcater
    cannot empower a roll of 1 when casting this spell but ther is otherwise no limit
    on empowering this spell.\nIt may not be empowered above 18.\r"
