  itemDescription: This is a flat piece of ivory, about the size of a man's hand,
    with a spell etched onto its surface. When found, roll randomly on the spell
    table to see what spell it holds. The Ivory Scroll functions as a scroll with
    the following exceptions. It may be used once per game. After it is used, roll
    a die. On a 19 or 20, the scroll cracks and is destroyed. On any other result,
    it survives the casting and can be used again next game. This item can never
    be purchased.
