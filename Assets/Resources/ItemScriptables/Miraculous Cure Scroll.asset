  itemDescription: "Wizard only.\nThis spell may be used in several different ways.\nA
    successful casting of this spell will remove all permanent injuries from one
    figure.\nFor example, a wizard suffering from Lost Fingers regrows all their
    missing digits, regardless of how many times they have suffered that particular
    injury.\nOr, it may be cast on a Badly Wounded figure -  if successful, the soldier
    is healed and may participate in the next game with no penalty.\nFinally, it
    may be used to attempt to bring a figure back from the dead.\nThe figure must
    have died in the game just played, and using the spell in this fashion incurs
    a -4 penalty to the Casting Roll.\nIf successful, the figure is restored to life,
    and may participate in the next game with no penalty.\nIf Miraculous Cure is
    cast using a scroll, it cannot be used to resurrect the dead.\r"
