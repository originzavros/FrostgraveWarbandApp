  itemDescription: "This spell temporarily enchants a musical instrument to play
    louder and more clearly than before.\nOnly a spellcaster may use such an enchanted
    instrument (max one per figure), and gains +2 Will while doing so.\nThis enchanted
    instrument does not take up an item slot, and the enchantment lasts until the
    end of the game.\nAfter the game, however, a spellcaster that successfully cast
    this spell during the game may make one further attempt to cast it as an Out
    of game spell.\nIf successful, a permanent magic item is created - it grants
    +2 Will bonus to the bearer, takes up an item slot, and may be used by a spellcaster
    or bard, subject to all rules for magic items.\r"
