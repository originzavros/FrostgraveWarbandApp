  itemDescription: 'Once per game, the wearer of this ring may activate it as a free
    action during their activation.

    For the rest of that activation, they may
    ignore movement penalties for terrain, including climbing, and no figure may
    force combat with them.

    However, the wearer may not attack any other figure
    or pick up treasure, and if the figure was carrying treasure, it is dropped at
    the point at which the ring was activated.'
