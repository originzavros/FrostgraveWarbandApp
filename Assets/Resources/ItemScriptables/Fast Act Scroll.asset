  itemDescription: "This spell may only be cast on a member of the spellcaster's
    warband or an uncontrolled creature.\nThis figure will activate at the end of
    the current phase instead of in it's normal phase.\nFor example, if an apprentice
    casts this spell on an uncontrolled creature, the creature will activate at the
    end of that player's Apprentice phase instead of the Creature phase.\nSpellcasters
    may not cast this spell on themselves, nor on a figure that has already activated
    in the current turn.\r"
