  itemDescription: 'This spell may be cast on any terrain feature within 12" that
    has a flat side, such as most ruins.

    Place a token on or next to the terrain
    feature to represent the Wizard Eye.

    For the rest of the game, the caster
    may choose to drawa  line of sight from the Wizard Eye instead of from the figure
    when casting spells.

    The Wizard Eye has 180-degree field fo vision.

    A
    spellcaster may only maintain one Wizard Eye at a time.

    If the terrain piece
    on which the Wizard Eye is placed is damaged or destroyed (such as by a Crumble
    spell) the spell is cancelled.

    The spellcaster may cancel this spell at
    the end of any turn.'
