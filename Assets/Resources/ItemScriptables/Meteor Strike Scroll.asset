    marker. At the start of the spellcaster's next activation, all figures within
    3\" and line of sight of this point suffer a +7 shooting attack.\nFigures receive
    cover as though line of sight were drawn from the target point.\nAll figures
    that suffer this attack are also thrown 3\" in a random direction, even if they
    are currently in combat. \nIf the spellcaster leaves the table before his next
    activation, this spell is cancelled.\r"
