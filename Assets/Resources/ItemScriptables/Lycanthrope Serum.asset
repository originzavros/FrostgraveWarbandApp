  itemDescription: 'A figure that drinks this potion is immediately replaced witha
    werewolf (Frostgrave rulebook, page 120). This werewolf still counts as part
    fo the player''s warband for all intents and purposes, except that it can neither
    pick up or secure treasure.

    The figure cannot use or be given items, an
    any it was carrying prior to its transformation are returned to it at the end
    of the game.

    After the game, the figure reverts to normal. If the figure
    was not reduced to 0 Health during the game, it must still make a survival roll,
    but with a +2 modifier.'
