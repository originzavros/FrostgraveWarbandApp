  itemDescription: "A skeletal hand reaches out of the ground and grabs the target's
    ankle.\nThe figure may not take any move acitons until it escapes.\nAny form
    of magic movement, except the Leap spell, allows a figure to escape the hand;\notherwise,
    the only way to escape is to fight the hand, which has Fight +0, health 1.\nIf
    the hand takes one point of damage, it vanishes, and the target is free.\nOther
    figures in base contact may attack the hand or give a support bonus.\nIf the
    hand wins the fight, it does damage as normal.\nThis spell may only be cast against
    a target that is standing on the ground.\nLarge creatures are unaffected by this
    spell.\nThe maximum range for this spell is 18\".\r"
