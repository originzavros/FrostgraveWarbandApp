  itemDescription: "The target is attacked by a sharp animated quill.\nAlthough the
    quill does no damage, it is highly irritating and extremely distracting.\nWhile
    under attack, the taret suffers -1 Move, -2 Fight, -4 Shoot, and -2 to all Casting
    Rolls.\nWhenever the target is activated, it may make a Will Roll with a Target
    Number equal to the Casting Roll - if successful, the quill is caught and destroyed.\nMultiple
    castings of Furious Quill against the same target have no effect.\r"
