  itemDescription: "This spell may only be cast on a member of the spellcaster's
    warband.\nImmediately move the target figure up to 10\" in any direction, including
    vertically.\nThis move must either be in a straight line or an arc.\nIt cannot
    curve around corners.\nIf this move leaves the figure above the ground, it immediately
    falls, taking damage as normal.\nIf the target is carrying treasure, this move
    is reduced to 5\".\nThis move may not take a figure off the table or into combat.\nThe
    target of the Leap spell may take no other actions this turn, though it may have
    taken actions previously.\r"
