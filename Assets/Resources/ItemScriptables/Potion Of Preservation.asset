  itemDescription: 'This potion may be used on any figure, other than a wizard, who
    died in the previous game.

    this potion perfectly preserves the body of the
    figure for the next five games.

    After each of the next five games, a wizard
    may use an elixir of life portion or a Miraculous Cure spell on the preserved
    figure.

    While a figure is preserved, it does not count as a member of the
    warband for the purpose of calculating maximum warband size, but will do so if
    brought back to life.

    A wizard may not hire another apprentice if they have
    one preserved.

    If, after the fight game, the preserved figure has not been
    brough back to life, it is dead, and shoudl be removed from the Wizard Sheet.'
