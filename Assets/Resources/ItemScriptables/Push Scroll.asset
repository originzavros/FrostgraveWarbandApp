  itemDescription: "The target suffers an immediate +10 attack.\nInstead of taking
    damage from this attack, the target is moved 1\" directly away from the spellcaster
    for every point of damage they would have taken.\nIf this pushes the target into
    the edge of the table or a piece of terrain over 1/2\" high, they stop immediately.
    \nOther figures do not stop (or get hit by) a pushed figure - they are assumed
    to step out of the way.\nIf this spell is cast from beneath a figure it will
    push them up.\nIf the target is pushed up or off a height, it suffers falling
    damage as normal.\nThis spell can push a figure out of combat, and as it is not
    a shooting attack, the target is not randomized.\r"
