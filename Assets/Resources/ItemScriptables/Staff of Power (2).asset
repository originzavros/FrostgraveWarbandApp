  itemDescription: "Items of power provide a spellcaster with an additional pool
    from which they can draw to empower a spell or Will Roll in the same way as they
    can using their own Health. The number in brackets is the amount of power that
    can be drawn from an item before the pool runs dry. So, a staff of power (3)
    can be used to increase a single Casting Roll by +3, three Casting Rolls by +1
    each, or one by +2 and one by +1. This power can be used in conjunction with
    the spellcaster\u2019s Health to empower a spell. So, a wizard needing to increase
    a Casting Roll by 5 could use 3 from a staff of power and 2 from their own Health.
    Spellcasters using these items are still subject to the standard rules for and
    limitations on empowerment.Staffs, rings, and wands of power recharge between
    games, but orbs of power do not regenerate \u2013 once it has been tapped for
    6 points of additional power it is empty and can\u2019t even be sold."
