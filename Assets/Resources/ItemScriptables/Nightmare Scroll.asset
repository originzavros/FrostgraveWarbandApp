  itemDescription: "This spell may only be cast directly before a game.\nThe spell
    targets a wizard from one of the opposing warbands in the game about to be played.\nWhen
    experience is calculated after the game, the target loses 20 experience points
    from the amount earned during the game.\nThis cannot take the experience earned
    below zero.\nThe effects of this spell continues in every subsequent game which
    includes both the spellcaster and the target.\nThis spell cannot be cancelled
    with Dispel or Spelleater, nor is it affected by any kind of null energy.\nThe
    only way to end the effects of this spell is for the target to play in a game
    in whihc the spellcaster is reduced to 0 Health.\nAs soon as this happens, spell
    is cancelled.\nIf this occurs in the game immediately following the spell being
    cast, the target suffers no experience penalty.\r"
