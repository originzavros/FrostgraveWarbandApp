  itemDescription: This old inn has plenty of room to house soldiers and their gear.
    The wizard may keep an extra soldier in their warband. This soldier can be a
    specialist. However, this extra soldier cannot be used in a game and must remain
    in the base. Even with an inn, a wizard is still limited to eight soldiers in
    a game, with a maximum of four specialists. The wizard may change which soldier
    is left in the inn each game, which is useful if a soldier must miss a game due
    to injury.
