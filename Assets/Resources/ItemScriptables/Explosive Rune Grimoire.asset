  itemDescription: "The spellcaster draws a bright, glowing rune of power on the
    ground or wall anywhere within 4\" and line of sight.\nA marker should be placed
    on the table to represent the rune.\nIf any character or creature that was not
    part of the spellcaste's warband at the start of the game moves within 1\" of
    the rune, it explodes, and every figure, friend or foe, within 2\" suffers and
    immediate +5 magic attack.\nNote that if the rune is placed within 1\" of a figure,
    it does not explode immediately - that figure must move to set it off.\nA spellcaster
    may have up to three such runes in play at any time.\nAt the end of any turn,
    they may choose to cancel any or all their runes.\nIf the spellcaster that placed
    the rune is no longer on the table, roll a die for each rune at the end of each
    turn: on a 11+ the rune vanishes.\r"
