  itemName: Book of the Rangifer
  itemDescription: A wizard that possesses a Book of the Rangifer may include one
    Rangifer in his warband at the cost of 100gc (In App adds hire option in Hire
    Soldiers)(The wizard does not need to carry the book to use this ability, it
    can be stored in the vault.). The rangifer takes the place of a soldier and has
    all the rules of a soldier. Rangifers hate the undead, and will not serve in
    a warband that has undead. A wizard can take control of an undead during a game
    without insulting the Rangifer, but if undead are present in the warband before
    or after a game the rangifer will permamently leave the warband.
