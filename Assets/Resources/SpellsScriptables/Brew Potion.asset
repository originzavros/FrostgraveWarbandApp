  Description: "The spellcaster creates one Lesser Potion of their choice (page 86)
    that may be sold, stored in the wizard's vault or given to a member of the warband.\nA
    wizard (and only wizard) may use this spell to create a Greater Potion (page
    87). \nFirst, they must declare what potion they are attempting to brew and pay
    the listed ingredients cost.\nThe wizard should then roll to cast Brew Potion
    with a -4 to the Casting Roll.\nIf successful, the potion is created and can
    be immediately assigned to a figure in the warband, sold, or stored in the wizard's
    vault.\nIf unsuccessful, the potion is not created and the money spent on ingredients
    is lost.\r"
