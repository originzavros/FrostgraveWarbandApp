  Restriction: Line of Sight
  Description: "Pick a target point within 20\" and line of sight and place a marker.
    At the start of the spellcaster's next activation, all figures within 3\" and
    line of sight of this point suffer a +7 shooting attack.\nFigures receive cover
    as though line of sight were drawn from the target point.\nAll figures that suffer
    this attack are also thrown 3\" in a random direction, even if they are currently
    in combat. \nIf the spellcaster leaves the table before his next activation,
    this spell is cancelled.\r"
