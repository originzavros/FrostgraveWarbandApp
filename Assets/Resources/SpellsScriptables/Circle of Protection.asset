  Description: "Creates a circle with a 3\" diameter which no demon or undead creature
    can enter or pass through.\nIf something forces them into contact with the circle,
    they stop at its edge.\nA spellcaster may only have one active circle of protection
    at a time, but they do not have to remain within it.\nThe spellcaster may cancel
    this spell at the end of any turn.\nOtherwise, roll a die at the end of every
    turn: on a 1-3 the spell is cancelled.\r"
