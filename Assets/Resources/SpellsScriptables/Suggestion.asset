  Description: "The target of this spell immediately drops any treasure tokens it
    is carrying.\nThe spellcaster may move the figure up to 3\" in any direction
    provided this does not move the figure into combat or cause it any immediate
    damage (e.g. falling more than 3\").\nThe target of this spell may make a Will
    Roll with a Target Number equal to the Casting Roll.\nIf successful, the spell
    has no effect.\r"
