  Description: "The target figure must make an immediate Will Roll with a Target
    Number equal to the Casting Roll.\nIf it fails, the target temporarily joins

    each turn, it must make another Will Roll with a Target Number equal to the Casting
    Roll.\nIf successful, the spell is cancelled and the figure returns to its normal
    allegiance.\nA spellcaster may only have one active Mind Control spell at a time.\nA
    figure under Mind Control cannot purposely take any action that causes it immediate
    damage but can be moved into combat and may attack an enemy figure.\nA figure
    under Mind Control is not allowed to move off teh table.\nA spellcaster may cancel
    an active Mind Control at the end of any turn.\nThis spell has no effect on spellcasters.\r"
