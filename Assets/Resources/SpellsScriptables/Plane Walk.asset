  Description: "Although the spellcaster remains in the same physical location, they
    move briefly between planes of existence.\nFor the rest of this turn, they can
    ignore all terrain when moving, thus walking though walls or across chasms.\nThey
    may not be the target of any shooting attacks or spells.\nThe spellcaster will
    never be considered in combat during the turn, nor can they be attacked by any
    figure.\nThey may not, however, pick up treasure or in any way affect other figures
    or terrain on the table.\nIf they are carrying treasure, they drop it.\nIt is
    incredibly draining to move between planes of existence, so if a spellcaster
    attempts to cast this spell in a second consecutive turn, they suffer a -5 modifier
    to their Casting Roll, -10 if they attmpt it three turns in a row, and 15 on
    the fourth turn and beyond.\r"
