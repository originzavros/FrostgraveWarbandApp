  Restriction: Self Only & Out of Game(A)
  Description: "This spell temporarily enchants a musical instrument to play louder
    and more clearly than before.\nOnly a spellcaster may use such an enchanted instrument
    (max one per figure), and gains +2 Will while doing so.\nThis enchanted instrument
    does not take up an item slot, and the enchantment lasts until the end of the
    game.\nAfter the game, however, a spellcaster that successfully cast this spell
    during the game may make one further attempt to cast it as an Out of game spell.\nIf
    successful, a permanent magic item is created - it grants +2 Will bonus to the
    bearer, takes up an item slot, and may be used by a spellcaster or bard, subject
    to all rules for magic items.\r"
