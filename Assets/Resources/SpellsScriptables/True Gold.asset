  Description: "The spellcaster may attempt to cast this spell before rolling for
    treasure.\nIf successful, the spellcaster may roll two dice and choose which
    one to keep when making the first roll to determine what treasure has been found.\nIf
    both dice roll the same number, however, the token is lost - experience is still
    gained, but no treasure is found.\r"
