  Description: "The spellcaster used the parchment of a long scroll to create a temporary
    bridge, ramp, or staircase.\nPlace a bridge 6\" long and 2\" wide anywhere that
    is completely in the line of sight of the spellcaster.\nThe bridge has no appreciable
    thickness ans is essentially two dimensional.\nThe ends of this bridge do not
    have to be on the same horizontal plane, nor do teh ends of the bridge need to
    be anchored on terrain, they may float in the air.\nFigures may move along this
    bridge at their normal movement rate, even when essentially climbing.\nEach spellcaster
    may only have one bridge in play at any time.\nWhenever the spellcaster activates,
    they may cancel this spell as a free action.\nOtherwise roll a die at the end
    of every turn: On a 1-2 the bridge vanishes.\nFigures on the bridge when it vanishes
    will fall to the ground. \r"
