  Description: "The target figure is attacked by a cloud of stining or biting insects
    that irritate and distract.\nThe cloud of insects has a 1\" radius centered on,
    and moving with, the target figure.\nIt affects all figures, including the target
    figure, fully or partially within it's radius.\nWhile being pestered by insects,
    a figure has -4 Fight and -4 Shoot (to a minimum of +0) and -2 to Casting Rolls.\nAfter
    this figure activates each turn, it may make a Will Roll with a Target Number
    equal to the Casting Roll.\nIf successful, the spell is cancelled.\nOther figures
    in the radius may simply move away to escape.\nA figure may only ever be affected
    by one Plague of Insects spell at a time, whether as a target or by virtue of
    being within the 1\" radius.\nLarge creatures, undead, and constructs are immune
    to this spell.\r"
