  Description: "The target figure becomes invisible.\nNo figure may move into combat
    with the invisible figure, nor target it with any attack or spell(although it
    may still be affected by area effects, such as the blast radius of a grenade
    spell).\nIf the invisible figure moves into combat, casts a spell, or picks up
    a treasure token, the Invisibility spell is cancelled.\nThis spell may be cast
    on a figure already carrying treasure, rendering both invisible.\nIn this case,
    if the figure drops the treasure, the spell is cancelled.\r"
