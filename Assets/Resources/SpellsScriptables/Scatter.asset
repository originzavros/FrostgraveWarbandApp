  Description: "This spell targets either an unclaimed treasure token or a figure
    carrying a treasure token.\nThe spellcaster may move the token up to 6\" in a
    randomly determined direction.\nThe distance can be decided after the direction
    is determined.\nIf a figure is carrying the token, it may make a Fight Roll witha
    Target Number of 20 to hold onto it - if unsuccessful, the figure drops it, and
    the token is moved in the same manner above.\r"
