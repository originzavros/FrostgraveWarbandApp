  Description: "This spell switches the position of two figures on the table.\nThe
    two figures being transposed must both be within line of sight of the spellcaster
    and within 12\" of one another.\nThe spellcaster may cast transpose to switch
    themselves with another figure.\nMembers of the opposing warbands are eligible
    targets for being transposed but may make a Will Roll with a Target Number equal
    to the Casting Roll to attempt to resist the spell.\nIf successful, the spell
    is cancelled and no figures are moved.\nFriendly figures and uncontrolled creatures
    will not make such Will Rolls.\r"
