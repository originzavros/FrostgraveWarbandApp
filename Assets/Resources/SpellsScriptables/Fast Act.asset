  Description: "This spell may only be cast on a member of the spellcaster's warband
    or an uncontrolled creature.\nThis figure will activate at the end of the current
    phase instead of in it's normal phase.\nFor example, if an apprentice casts this
    spell on an uncontrolled creature, the creature will activate at the end of that
    player's Apprentice phase instead of the Creature phase.\nSpellcasters may not
    cast this spell on themselves, nor on a figure that has already activated in
    the current turn.\r"
