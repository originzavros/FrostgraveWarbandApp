  Description: "This spell can only target inanimate structures such as buildings
    and walls.\nThe spellcaster rapidly speeds up the passing of time in a small
    area of the structure, causing it to collapse.\nThis can create a doorway-sized
    hold through any wall, which should be indicated on the table somehow.\nThe spell
    can also be used to collapse a section of floor beneath a figure standing on
    a level above the ground.\nIn this case, the figure about to be affeted must
    pass a Move Roll (TN22) or fall to the next level down and taking damage appropriately.\nIf
    this spell is cast on a wall created by the Wall spell, the wall is completely
    destroyed.\nIf it is cast on terrain holding a Wizard Eye, the Wizard Eye is
    cancelled.\r"
