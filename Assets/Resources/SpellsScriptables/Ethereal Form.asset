  Description: "The spellcaster becomes ethereal until the start of his next activation.\nHe
    may move through terrain as though it were not there and ignores all movement
    penalties for terrain, including climbing.\nThe figure may not pick up treasure
    and drops any treasure it was carrying.\nOnly another ethereal figure may force
    combat with the figure.\nThe figure still fights as normal, but can only cause
    damage if it is using a magic weapon.\nThe figure is immune to non-magic weapons.\nIf
    a spellcaster successfully casts this spell again the following turn, they gain
    the above benefits as normal, but automatically suffers 5 damage.\r"
