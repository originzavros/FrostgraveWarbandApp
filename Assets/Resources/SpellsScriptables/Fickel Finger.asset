  Description: "This spell may be cast on any figure within 6\" of the spellcaster.\nWhenever
    this figure is activated, roll a die: on a 1-5 the figure receives one action
    fewer (minimum 0), on a 6-15 nothing happens, and on a 16-20 the figure receives
    one additional action (max 3).\nOn a roll of 1 or 20, the spell ends after the
    figure's activation.\nOtherwise, the spell remains until the end of the game.\nMultiple
    castings fo this spell on the same figure have no effect.\r"
