  Description: "This spell may be cast on any terrain feature within 12\" that has
    a flat side, such as most ruins.\nPlace a token on or next to the terrain feature
    to represent the Wizard Eye.\nFor the rest of the game, the caster may choose
    to drawa  line of sight from the Wizard Eye instead of from the figure when casting
    spells.\nThe Wizard Eye has 180-degree field fo vision.\nA spellcaster may only
    maintain one Wizard Eye at a time.\nIf the terrain piece on which the Wizard
    Eye is placed is damaged or destroyed (such as by a Crumble spell) the spell
    is cancelled.\nThe spellcaster may cancel this spell at the end of any turn.\r"
