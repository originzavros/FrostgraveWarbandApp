  Description: "The spellcaster fills a skull with magic malice and throws it at
    an opponent.\nPlace one animated skull (page 190) within 6\" of the spellcaster.\nIt
    can be placed directly into combat.\nThis skull is an uncontrolled creature.\nThe
    spellcaster may not cast this spell again until this creature is removed from
    the table, but may spend an action to cancel the spell, in which case the animated
    skull is immediately removed from the table.\r"
