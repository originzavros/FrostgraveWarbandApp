  Description: "This spell may only be cast on a member of the spellcaster's warband.\nImmediately
    move the target figure up to 10\" in any direction, including vertically.\nThis
    move must either be in a straight line or an arc.\nIt cannot curve around corners.\nIf
    this move leaves the figure above the ground, it immediately falls, taking damage
    as normal.\nIf the target is carrying treasure, this move is reduced to 5\".\nThis
    move may not take a figure off the table or into combat.\nThe target of the Leap
    spell may take no other actions this turn, though it may have taken actions previously.\r"
