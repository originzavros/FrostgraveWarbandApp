  Description: "The spellcaster may move any treasure token within 16\" by up to
    6\" in any direction, so along as it remains in line of sight the entire time.\nIf
    the treasure moves out of line of sight, it immediately falls straight to the
    ground.\nThis spell has no effect on a treasure token that has any special requirements
    for how and when it can be picked up, nor on one being carried by a figure.\nThis
    spell may not target the central treasure, until after that treasure has been
    picked up for the first time.\r"
