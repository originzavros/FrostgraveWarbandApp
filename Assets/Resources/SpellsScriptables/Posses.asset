  Description: "This spell may only be cast on a permanent or temporary member of
    the spellcaster's own warband, except the wizard, apprentice, or demons.\nThe
    target is possessed by a demon and gains +2 Fight, +1 Armor, and -2 Will and
    counts as a demon (i.e. it will be affected by Banish, Control Demon, Circle
    of Protection, etc.).\nThis figure may not be part of a group activation.\nIf
    removed from the game for any reason (such as being hit by a Banish spell), check
    for the character's survival as normal.\nA spellcaster may only have one Possess
    sepll active at a time.\r"
