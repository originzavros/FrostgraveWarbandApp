  Description: "The spellcaster takes an object, commonly a simple rock, imbues it
    with magic energy and throws it at their target, whereupon it explodes into hundreds
    of fragments.\nThe spellcaster picks a traget point within 14\". \nEvery figure,
    including allies, within 1.5\" of that point immediately suffers a +3 magic shooting
    attack.\nUs the target point as the origin of the attack for working out line
    of sight and cover.\r"
