  Description: "This spell causes anyone who looks on the spellcaster to see a paragon
    of beauty.\nAny member of an opposing warband must make a Will Roll with a Target
    Number equal to the Casting Roll if they wish to do any of the following:\nmove
    into combat with the spellcaster, make a shooting attack that could potentially
    hit the spellcaster (including shooting attacks generated by spells),\nor cast
    any spell that targets the spellcaster.\nSpellcasters may empower this Will Roll
    in the same way they would resist a spell. \nA figure may only attempt such a
    Will Roll once per turn.\nThis spell has no effect on creatures (anythng found
    in Chapter Six: Bestiary, page 176) or war hounds.\r"
