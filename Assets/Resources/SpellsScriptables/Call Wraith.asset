  Description: "The spellcaster may place a wraith (core book, pg 112) on the table
    anywhere within line of sight.\nAfter the wraith is placed, roll a die and immediately
    move the wraith that many inches in a random direction.\nIf this would take the
    wraith off the board, then it is lost and is out of the game.\nOtherwise it activates
    in the next creature phase as normal.\nThis wraith is an uncontrolled creature.\r"
