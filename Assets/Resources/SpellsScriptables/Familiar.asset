  Description: "The spellcaster gains a familiar, which can take the form of any
    small creature.\nIt is not depicted on the table, unless the player wants to
    include it on the spellcaster figure.\nA spellcaster with a familiar grants +2
    Health(write as a split stat).\nIf the spellcaster is ever reduced to 1 Health
    or less, the familiar is destroyed.\nAt the start of the next game, the spellcaster
    reverts to their normal Health, unless another Familiar spell is successfully
    cast.\r"
